# 3D_Image_Processing
Image Processing Techniques for Brain MRI

In this repo I demonstrate all the pre-processing phases we applied on 3D MRI brain images.
The preprocessing was done so we can give the pre-processed 3D images to a Unet to perform image segementation to detect pathological lesions in the brain.
